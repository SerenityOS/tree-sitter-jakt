* change Foo::boo::bar() to "scoped_identifier" instead of "static_member_expression"

  [FIXED] The syntax highlighting is broken for this in jakt...

  Foo::boo::bar();

  Is

  ```
  source_file [0, 0] - [1, 0]
    call_expression [0, 0] - [0, 15]
      function: scoped_identifier [0, 0] - [0, 13]
        path: scoped_identifier [0, 0] - [0, 8]
          path: identifier [0, 0] - [0, 3]
          name: identifier [0, 5] - [0, 8]
        name: identifier [0, 10] - [0, 13]
      arguments: arguments [0, 13] - [0, 15]
  ```

  in rust, which I think is more accurate and can also apply to Jakt.

* remove or add '_' to the rules

    A standard is needed for consistency.

    I am unsure why many TS parsers prepend '_' to begin with...

* roadmapgen.py
    * allow viwing original tests in check table
    * allow saving check table to markdown table

* change static_member_expression to static_call_expression (maybe?)

    I'm not sure what the C++ feature is called...

* add tests for optional types

* submit queries to https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter

    https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter/issues/2282

* add github actions

    * pytest tests
    * mypy on the python scripts
    * tree-sitter tests
    * roadmap.py does not flag any tests as out-of-date

* get github to syntax highlight Jakt on Github

    How to add a new grammar to github: https://github.com/github/linguist/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#adding-a-language

    1. A grammar will only be added to github after it has been used by 200 unique users and projects
    2. The linguist issue #5844 (mar 2022) mentions Github is moving to tree-sitter for syntax highlighting.
       1. The issues mentions: `"Contact GitHub" link on any page on GitHub.` to enquire
          about adding a tree-sitter grammar to github.
