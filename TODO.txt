* change Foo::boo::bar() to "scoped_identifier" instead of "static_member_expression"

  [FIXED] The syntax highlighting is broken for this in jakt...

  Foo::boo::bar();

  Is

  ```
  source_file [0, 0] - [1, 0]
    call_expression [0, 0] - [0, 15]
      function: scoped_identifier [0, 0] - [0, 13]
        path: scoped_identifier [0, 0] - [0, 8]
          path: identifier [0, 0] - [0, 3]
          name: identifier [0, 5] - [0, 8]
        name: identifier [0, 10] - [0, 13]
      arguments: arguments [0, 13] - [0, 15]
  ```

  in rust, which I think is more accurate and can also apply to Jakt.

* remove or add '_' to the rules

    A standard is needed for consistency.

    I am unsure why many TS parsers prepend '_' to begin with...

    15:25 Sat Jul 23 2022: it seems variables leading with '_' are private in the ts
    AST.

        For example, I found that

            _c_header_identfier: $ => token(seq('"', identifier, '.h"')),

        will not show `(c_header_identfier)` in the AST output when used like so:

            import_statement: $ => prec.right(seq(
              'import',
              optional(choice(
                  seq('extern', 'c', $._c_header_identfier),
                  seq($.identifier, optional(seq('as', $.identifier)))
              )),
              optional(field('body', $.import_block)),
            )),


* submit queries to https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter

    https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter/issues/2282

* add github actions

    * pytest tests
    * mypy on the python scripts
    * tree-sitter tests
    * roadmap.py does not flag any tests as out-of-date

* get github to syntax highlight Jakt on Github

    How to add a new grammar to github: https://github.com/github/linguist/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#adding-a-language

    1. A grammar will only be added to github after it has been used by 200 unique users and projects
    2. The linguist issue #5844 (mar 2022) mentions Github is moving to tree-sitter for syntax highlighting.
       1. The issues mentions: `"Contact GitHub" link on any page on GitHub.` to enquire
          about adding a tree-sitter grammar to github.
